Project for applied data science deliverables

Hello guys!

These are the deliverables for each team:

Shada:

1.Send/Upload here all the CSV files containing the data that have to be visualised. The data need to be clean and ready for the machine learning and visulazation procedures.

2.Create a txt file in which you mention the data that are the most important according to you. These are the most important columns in the CSV file and these collumns will be turned into the input data for machine learning and visualization procedures.

3.Create a txt file in which you briefly explain  how you managed to load in the database this huge amount of data, the tools that you used and justify your selections.

Bao & Yuefeng:

1.What have you tested so far? (Create a list of all the models that you have applied)

2.What is the model that you find more appropriate for our implementation and what is the final values of the parameters included in that model and why?

3.Create a flow chart that represents the way you process the data (similar to the one you have already showed me).

4.What is the possible outputs created after applying the machine learning algorithms and how can we be benefit from them?

5.Give the final score of the model that evaluates the models overall performance.

Christos & Katerina:

1.Propose the type of posible charts that can be included and fit the types of searches we want to perform.

2.Choose the adequate python library and jystify how this library managed to meet the requirements of our searches.

3.Create interactive charts that can be adapted to the user's preferences and are capable of depicting the differences between the data.

4.Create interactive charts that can accept data input from the user.
